TDS PROJECT 1 / TORONTO:100
# - Data Collection
The data was collected through GitHub's API using location-based and follower-count filters to identify active users and analyze their profiles and repositories. Data from Toronto-based users with 100+ followers was gathered to understand the impact of user profile settings, language usage, and repository features on engagement.
- An  interesting fact observed was that Hireable people tend to have more followers and Repositories with desciptions had higher stars which was an unexpected correlation.
- From the above observations it would be better if developers tried writing descriptions and bios as they had positive impacts over the follower counts.
