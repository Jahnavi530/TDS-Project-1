TDS PROJECT 1 / TORONTO:100
- I scraped the users.csv and repositories.csv from GitHub using the GitHub API by creating a personal token which is not metioned in the colab file uploaded for security reasons. The token had repos and users scopes enabled.
- An  interesting fact observed was that Hireable people tend to have more followers and Repositories with desciptions had higher stars which was an unexpected correlation.
- From the above observations it would be better if developers tried writing descriptions and bios as they had positive impacts over the follower counts.
